# Paperclip Tracker
Chrome extension to track and display stats in the game [universal paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/)

# Background
I recently rediscovered this game and got super hooked on it for a few days. At the end I found myself disappointed that there was no summary or stat tracking so I decided to hack together a quick chrome extension to track some core metrics and display simple charts.

# Planned Imporvements

I do plan on working more on this, but it may be awhile before I have the time.

  - General UI improvements
    - Chart zooming
    - Axis scale selection
  - More efficient timeseries data handling
  - Ability to export timeseries as a CSV file
